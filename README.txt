This repo contains my current portolio website.  It is a work in progress, but has been a great way to develop my front-end skillset.

The site has a simple, minimalist design. It includes a (configurable) parallax background effect, Poptrox-powered
lightbox gallery, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and Sass sources for the Sass-inclined.

(* = Not included)

To develop the contact form working (possible future addition) formspree.io will be used.
